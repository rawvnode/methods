## Target Goals

{{< ticks >}}

* 1 - Connect all of the software delivery activities to measurable business outcomes.

* 2 - Empower application operators to deploy services, both stateless and stateful, **without human intervention**

{{< /ticks >}}

In order to achieve the above goals, the focus for the application delivery framework should be **flow** over siloed specializations. The [open source OAM spec](https://oam.dev/) will be used as the foundational building block on which the framework will be built upon.

Operational capabilities referred to as Traits will fully leverage the cloud native ecosystem either by reusing existing capabilities or by creating lightweight shims around the capabilities allowing platform builders to strike a right balance between extensibility and abstraction.
